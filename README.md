# Msearch-debian
Msearch is a simple commandâ€‘line tool that fetches Google results using SerpAPI and prints a readable summary. It prefers the AI Overview when available; otherwise falls back to common fields (answer box, knowledge graph, or top organic snippet). It can also print sources when present.
